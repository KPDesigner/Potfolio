We try to arrange  provided data according to the syllabus and provide video link related to every topic. It is very difficult task for students to find out and study those topic they missed  at college due to some reason. We agree that, now a days whole information is available on Internet, but students are confused that which data is efficient for university based exam. In our project we refer textbook, reference book as per R.T.M.N.U and trusted video links which can helps students to study better and efficient.</p>

                    The outcome of our project will possibly reduce the effort and crucial time of students who are searching and surfing over Internet for perfect data. The further implementation of this project can be used for whole college and every department. Once the initial modules get completed and is accepted by the society.
